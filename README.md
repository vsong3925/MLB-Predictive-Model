# MLB-Predictive-Model

This project involves assessing a dataset containing all pitches from the 2011 MLB season and related metadata to build a predictive model. The goal is to predict the probability of the next pitch being a fastball, slider, change-up, or other pitch types. The tasks include:

### Data Analysis: 
Evaluate the dataset, perform exploratory analysis, and visualize key insights using plots and graphs.

### Feature Engineering: 
Identify and prepare features relevant to the prediction task.

### Model Development: 
Outline the model-building process, build a predictive model, and evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness.

### Documentation: 
Present findings, analysis, and results using a Python notebook with explanatory markup text. Include an HTML version of the notebook for easier review.

### Future Recommendations: 
Provide details on potential next steps for refining the project if more time were available.
