# MLB-Predictive-Model

### Project Description: 
This project involves assessing a dataset containing all pitches from the 2011 MLB season and related metadata to build a predictive model. The goal is to predict the probability of the next pitch being a fastball, slider, change-up, or other pitch types. The tasks include:

1. Data Analysis: Evaluate the dataset, perform exploratory analysis, and visualize key insights usin plots and graphs.
2. Feature Engineering: Identify and prepare features relevant to the prediction task.
3. Model Development: Outline the model-building process, build a predictive model, and evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness.
4. Documentation: Present findings, analysis, and results using a Python notebook with explanatory markup text. Include an HTML version of the notebook for easier review.
5. Future Recommendations: Provide details on potential next steps for refining the project if more time were available.



### Future Model Enhancement:
1. Add Pitcher Data:
Include information like how the pitcher throws (e.g., release point, arm angle). These details can give the model more context about what influences different pitch types.

2. Try More Advanced Data Features:
Look for patterns in the data, like combining stats or breaking them into new categories. This can help the model pick up on trends it might be missing now.
